\title{Using the Google Visualisation API with R:\\googleVis Package Vignette}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The \googleVis package provides an interface between R and the
  Google Visualisation API.  The Google Visualisation API offers
  interactive charts which can be embedded into web pages. The most
  well known of those charts is probably the Motion Chart, popularised
  by Hans Rosling in his TED talks.  With the \googleVis package users
  can create web pages with  interactive charts based on R data frames
  easily and display them either via the \texttt{R.rsp} package or
  within their own sites. Currently the package provides interfaces to
  Motion Charts, Geo Maps, Tables and Tree Maps.

\section{Motivation}
<<<<<<< .mine
More and more data is becoming available and accesible, and yet
stories and insights are still often missed. We are lost in the data
jungle and struggle to see the wood for the trees.

stories and insights are still often missed, as we sometimes struggle to see the wood for the trees.

Hence new tools are required to bring data to life, to engage with
users, to enable them to slice and dice the data, to view it from
various angles, to find stories worth telling: outliers, trends, and
sometimes even the bleeding obvious.

In 2006 Hans Rosling gave an inspiring talk at TED
~\cite{HansRoslingTedTalk} about social and economic developments in
the world over the last 50 years, which challenged the views and
perceptions of many listeners. Hans had used extensive data analysis
to come to his conclusions, with data sourced from the World Bank, UN,
IMF, etc.  To visualise his talk, he and his team at
Gapminder~\cite{Gapminder} had developed animated bubble charts, aka
motion charts, see Figure~\ref{MotionChartGUI}.

Rosling's presentation popularised the idea and use of interactive charts,
and as a result a few years later the software behind Gapminder was bought by Google and
integrated as motion charts into their visualisation API~\cite{GoogleMotionChartApi}.

In  2010 Sebasti\'{a}n P\'{e}rez Saaibi~\cite{Saaibi2010} presented at the R/Rmetrics Workshop on 
Computational Finance and Financial Engineering the idea to link motion charts with R 
using the \texttt{R.rsp} package~\cite{Rsp}.

to foster the dialog between data analysts, who are familiar with R, and others the authors of this vignette 
started the development of the \googleVis package.

\section{Google Visualisation API}

=======
The Google Visualisation API~\cite{GoogleMotionChartApi} allwos users
to integrate interactive charts within Google documents/spreadsheets,
but also web pages. 

The Google Public Data Explorer~\cite{GooglePublicData} provides a good
example, demonstrating the use of motion charts and how they can help to analyse data.
Please note, that all those charts are rendered within a browser using Adobe Flash~\cite{Flash}. 

The charting data can either be embedded into the html file or read dynamically.
Key to the Google Visualisation API is that the data is structured in
a DataTable~\cite{DataTable}, and this is where this package helps, as
it uses the functionality of the RJSONIO package~\cite{RJSONIO} to
transform R data frames into json~\cite{json} objects and as the basis
for the DataTable.

% \section{Example}
% The package comes with example data sets, e.g. \texttt{Fruits} and \texttt{Exports}.
% <<>>=
% require(googleVis)
% data(Fruits)
% Fruits
% data(Exports)
% Exports
% @
% The example data shows sales information by Fruit and Year (also Date to
% illustrate how to handle this data type). Suppose we would like to
% generate the html output required for a motion chart, than we can use
% the function \texttt{MotionChart}.
% <<>>=
% gvisMotionChart(Fruits[,-7], "Fruit", "Year") ## exclude Date column
% @
% Now we can also create a motion chart using the date colum. Please
% notice that
% <<>>=
% gvisMotionChart(Fruits[,-2], "Fruit", "Date") ## exclude Year column
% @
% The function \texttt{MotionChartPage} would top and tail the above output
% with some html tags to create a valid standalone page to be viewed.
% The page can be viewed immediately using the web server provided by
% the \texttt{R.rsp} package~\cite{Rsp}.

% Further examples are available via demos. See \texttt{demo('googleVis')} for a list of demos files.
