# Introduction

## Motivation

In 2006 Hans Rosling gave an inspiring talk at
TED [@HansRoslingTedTalk] about social and economic developments
in the world over the past 50 years, which challenged the views and
perceptions of many listeners. Rosling had used extensive data analysis
to reach his conclusions.  To visualise his [talk](https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen), he and his team at
Gapminder [@Gapminder] had developed animated bubble charts, aka
motion charts. 

Rosling's [presentation](https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen) popularised the idea and use of interactive
charts. One year later the software behind
Gapminder was bought by Google and integrated as motion charts into
their Google Charts API [@GoogleVisApi], formerly known as Google
Visualisation API.  

In 2010  Sebastián Pérez Saaibi [@Saaibi2010] presented at the 
R/Rmetrics Workshop on  Computational Finance and Financial
Engineering, the idea to use Google motion charts to visualise R
output with the `r CRANpkg("R.rsp")` package [@Rsp]. 

Inspired by those talks and the desire to use interactive data
visualisation tools to foster the dialogue between data analysts and
others the authors of this vignette started the development of the
`r CRANpkg("googleVis")` package 
[@RJournal:2011-2:GesmannCastillo] in August 2010. 

### Google Chart Tools

The Google Charts API [@GoogleVisApi]
allows users to create interactive charts as part of Google
documents, spreadsheets and web pages. In this text, we will focus 
on the usage of the API as part of web pages.

The Google Public Data Explorer [@GooglePublicData] provides a
good example, demonstrating the use of interactive charts and how they can
help to analyse data.

The charting data can either be embedded into the HTML file or read
dynamically. The key to the Google Charts is that the data is
structured in a DataTable [@DataTable], and this is where the googleVis
package helps, as it transforms R data frames into JSON [@json]
objects, using the `r CRANpkg("jsonlite")` package [@jsonlite], as
the basis for a DataTable. 

As an example we shall look at the html-code of a motion chart from
Google's visualisation gallery [@GoogleMotionChart].

```
 1 <html>
 2  <head>
 3   <script type="text/javascript" 
 4     src="https://www.google.com/jsapi">
 5   </script>
 6   <script type="text/javascript">
 7     google.load('visualization', '1', 
 8      {'packages':['motionchart']});
 9    google.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);
10    function drawChart() {
11    var data=new google.visualization.DataTable();
12    data.addColumn('string', 'Fruit');
13    data.addColumn('date', 'Date');
14    data.addColumn('number', 'Sales');
15    data.addColumn('number', 'Expenses');
16    data.addColumn('string', 'Location');
17    data.addRows([
18    ['Apples',new Date(1988,0,1),1000,300,'East'],
19    ['Oranges',new Date(1988,0,1),1150,200,'West'],
20    ['Bananas',new Date(1988,0,1),300,250,'West'],
21    ['Apples',new Date(1989,6,1),1200,400,'East'],
22    ['Oranges',new Date(1989,6,1),750,150,'West'],
23    ['Bananas',new Date(1989,6,1),788,617,'West']
24    ]);
25    var chart=new google.visualization.MotionChart(
26      document.getElementById('chart_div'));
27    chart.draw(data, {width: 600, height:300});
28   }
29   </script>
30  </head>
31  <body>
32   <div id="chart_div" 
33        style="width:600px; height:300px;">
34   </div>
35  </body>
36 </html>
```

The code and data are processed and rendered by the browser and is
not submitted to any server^[[Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/linechart#data-policy)]. 

You will notice that the above HTML code has five generic
parts:

-  references to Google's AJAX (l. 4) and Visualisation
  API (ll. 7 - 8),
-  data to visualise as a `DataTable` (ll. 11 - 24),
-  an instance call to create the chart (ll. 25 - 26),
-  a method call to draw the chart including options, shown
  here as width and height (l. 27),
-  an HTML `<div>` element to add the chart to the page (ll.
  32 -- 34).

These principles hold true for most of the interactive charts of the
Google Chart Tools, see the examples in the next section.

However, before you use the API you should read the [Google Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms/) [@GoogleTerms]. 

# The googleVis package 

The googleVis package provides an interface between R and the Google
Chart Tools. The functions of the package allow the user to
visualise data stored in R data frames with Google Charts.

The output of a googleVis function is HTML code that contains the
data and references to JavaScript functions hosted by Google. A
browser with an Internet connection is required to view
the output, and for a very few chart types, notably motion charts, also Flash. 
Examples of several chart types are shown below, which have been combined with 
the `gvisMerge` function.

```{r demos, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}

## Installation{#sec:Installation}

You can install googleVis in the usual way from CRAN, e.g.:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages('googleVis') 
```
The installation was successful if the
command `library(googleVis)` gives you the following message:

```{r echo=FALSE, quite=TRUE}
library(googleVis)
``` 
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(googleVis)
``` 
```{r echo=FALSE}
cat(googleVis:::gvisWelcomeMessage())
``` 

# Concepts of the googleVis package 

The individual functions of the googleVis package are documented in
the help pages. Here we will cover only the basic concepts of
the package.

As an example, we will show how to generate a geo chart. It works 
similarly for the other APIs. Further examples are covered in the demos^[See `demo(package="googleVis")` for a list of the available demos] of the googleVis
package.

The design of the visualisation functions is fairly generic. The name
of the visualisation function is  `'gvis' + ChartType`. So for
a geo chart we have: 

```{r GeoChart, eval = FALSE}
gchart <-  gvisGeoChart(data,
                     locationvar = "",
                     colorvar = "",
                     sizevar = "",
                     hovervar = "",
                     options = list(),
                     chartid)                     
```

Here `data` is the input `data.frame`, `locationvar`, 
`colorvar`, `sizevar` and `hovervar` specify the various columns 
used for the plot. Display options are set in an
optional list, which we discuss in more detail later. 
The options and data requirements
follow those of the Google Charts API  and are documented in the
help pages, see 

```{r eval=FALSE}
help('gvisGeoChart')
``` 

The argument `chartid` allows the user to set a chart ID of the
output chart manually. If the argument is missing a random ID using 
`tempfile(pattern='')`
will be generated. Unique chart  IDs are required to place more than
one chart on a web page. 

The output of a googleVis function is a list of lists (a nested list)
containing information about the chart type, chart ID and the HTML
code in a  sub-list with header, chart, caption and footer.

The idea behind this concept is that users can get a
complete web page, while at the same time offer a facility to extract 
specific parts, such as the chart itself. 
This is particularly helpful if the package functions
are used in solutions where the user wants to feed the visualisation
output into other sites.  

The output of a googleVis function will be of class `gvis`
and `list`. Generic print (`print.gvis`) and plot
(`plot.gvis`) functions exist to ease the handling of such objects. 

To illustrate the concept we shall create a Geo chart using the
`Exports` data set. 

## Geo Chart Example

Following the documentation of the Google Geo Chart API we need a
data set which has at least one column with the location
variable.

As an example we use the `Exports` data set:

```{r }
data(Exports)
Exports
```

Here we will use the columns `'Country'` and
`'Profit'` as location and colour variable respectively. 

```{r }
 gchart <-  gvisGeoChart(data = Exports, 
                      locationvar='Country',
                      colorvar='Profit',
                      options=list(projection="kavrayskiy-vii", 
                                   width=400, height=200))
```

The structural output of `gvisGeoChart` is a list of lists as
described below. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
 str(gchart)
``` 

```{r echo=FALSE}
## This statement avoids truncation
cat(paste(substring( capture.output( str(gchart) ) , 0, 66), sep="\n", collapse="\n"))
``` 

The first two items of the list contain information about the chart type
used and the individual chart ID: 

```{r }
gchart$type
gchart$chartid
``` 

The html output is a list with header, chart, caption and
footer. This allows the user to extract only certain parts
of the page, or to create a complete html page. 

The header part of the html page has only basic html and formatting tags: 

```{r }
print(gchart, tag='header')
``` 

Here we used the `print` statement with the tag
`'header'` instead of `gchart$html$header` to achieve
a formatted screen output. This is the same output as
`cat(gchart$html$chart)`. 

The actual Google visualisation code is stored with the data
as a named character vector in the `chart` item of the HTML
list. The chart is made up of several JavaScript and  HTML
statements. Please notice that the JavaScript functions are
uniquely named with the information of the chart  ID.
This concept allows the user get all the chart code directly or only
specific parts; see the examples in the help page of `print.gvis`
for more details.

```{r }
names(gchart$html$chart)
``` 

The complete chart can be displayed via:

```{r }
print(gchart, tag='chart')  ## or cat(gchart$html$chart)
```

Similarly you can also access specific components of the chart, e.g. (output truncated)

```{r eval=FALSE}
cat(gchart$html$chart['jsChart']) # or print(gchart, 'jsChart')
``` 

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat(paste(substring( capture.output( cat(gchart$html$chart['jsChart']) ) , 0, 66), sep="\n", collapse="\n"))
``` 

A basic chart caption and html footer are the final items of the html
list (output  truncated):

```{r eval=FALSE}
print(gchart, tag='caption')
``` 
```{r echo=FALSE}
cat(paste(substring( capture.output( cat(gchart$html$caption) ) , 0, 66), sep="\n", collapse="\n"))
``` 

```{r eval=FALSE}
print(gchart, tag='footer')
``` 
```{r echo=FALSE}
cat(paste(substring( capture.output( cat(gchart$html$footer) ) , 0, 66), sep="\n", collapse="\n"))
``` 

# Displaying gvis objects locally

To display the page locally, simply type:

```{r displaygchart, results='asis'}
plot(gchart)  # returns invisibly the file name
```


The plot method for `gvis`-objects creates HTML files in a temporary 
folder using the type and chart ID information of the object and it will display the output using the R built-in web server.   

Note that the chart caption provides a link to the chart code via
the chart ID for copy and paste.

The R command `tempdir()`  will show you the path of the
per-session temporary directory, in which the files were written.
You can write the chart into a local html file via the `print`
command with the file argument, e.g.

```{r eval=FALSE}
print(gchart, file="myGoogleVisChart.html")
``` 


Alternatively use the function `plot.gvis` explicitly,
e.g. suppose your html file is stored in
`/Users/JoeBloggs/myGoogleVisChart.html`. Using the
`plot.gvis` the file will be copied into a temporary directory
and displayed via the R HTTP help server with, in the same way as a
gvis-object: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot.gvis("/Users/JoeBloggs/myGoogleVisChart.html")
``` 


# Setting options

Setting the various options of a googleVis objects can be a bit
cumbersome at first. The options follow those of the Google
Charts API and can be set via a named list using the argument `options`.
In the following example, we create a line chart and set various
options:  

```{r LineChartWithOptions, results="asis"}
df <- data.frame(country=c("US", "GB", "BR"), 
                 val1=c(1,3,4), val2=c(23,12,32))

Line <-  gvisLineChart(df, xvar="country", yvar=c("val1","val2"),
                       options=list(
                         title="Hello World",
                         titleTextStyle="{color:'red', 
                                           fontName:'Courier', 
                                           fontSize:16}",                         
                         backgroundColor="#D3D3D3",                          
                         vAxis="{gridlines:{color:'red', count:3}}",
                         hAxis="{title:'Country', titleTextStyle:{color:'blue'}}",
                         series="[{color:'green', targetAxisIndex: 0},	
                                   {color: 'orange',targetAxisIndex:1}]",
                         vAxes="[{title:'val1'}, {title:'val2'}]",
                         legend="bottom",
                         curveType="function",
                         width=500,
                         height=300                         
                       ))
plot(Line)
```

As you can see from the example above, the simpler options can be set by `name=value`, e.g. `width=500`, while the more complex options with sub-components are
listed in curly brackets `{}` and arrays `[]`, e.g. to define the two
axes.

Generally, the following rules apply:


 - parameters with names that do not include a "." are set with a single 
 value, e.g. width and height. Those are set like one would do in R, that is
 `options=list(width=200, height=300)`. Boolean arguments are set to 
 either `TRUE` or `FALSE`, using the R syntax.
 - parameters with names that do not include a "." and are set with 
 multiple values, e.g. `color`, and are wrapped in `[ ]`, e.g. 
 `options=list(colors="['#cbb69d', '#603913', '#c69c6e']")`
 - parameters with names that do include a "." present parameters with 
 several sub-options and have to be set as a string wrapped in "\{ \}".
 The values of those sub-options are set via `parameter:value`. Boolean values
 have to be stated as `'true'` or `'false'`. 
 For example the Google documentation states the formatting options for the 
 vertical axis as `vAxis.format`. 
 Then this parameter can be set in R as:
 `options=list(vAxis="{format:'#,###%'}")`. 
 - If several sub-options have to be set, e.g. 
`titleTextStyle.color`, `titleTextStyle.fontName` and 
`titleTextStyle.fontSize`, then those can be combined in one list item 
such as: `options=list(titleTextStyle="{color:'red',fontName:'Courier', fontSize:16}")`
 - parameters that can have more than one value per sub-options are 
wrapped in `[ ]`. For example to set the labels for left and right axes use:
`options=list(vAxes="[{title:'val1'}, {title:'val2'}]")`


## Chart Editor

A special option for all charts is `gvis.editor`, which adds an
edit  button to the page, allowing the user to edit, change and
customise the chart on the fly. The content of the option `gvis.editor`
describes the label of the browser button.    
  
```{r chartEdit, results='asis'}
Editor <- gvisLineChart(df, options=list(gvis.editor='Edit me!'))
plot(Editor)
``` 




# Embedding googleVis in web sites

Suppose you have an existing web page and would like to integrate the
output of a googleVis function, such as `gvisLineChart`. 
In this case you only need the chart output from
`gvisLineChart`.  So you can either copy and paste the output
from the R console

```{r eval=FALSE}
print(gchart, 'chart')  ## or cat(gchart$html$chart) 
``` 

into your existing html page, or write the content directly into a file

```{r eval=FALSE}
print(gchart, 'chart', file='myfilename')
```

and process it from there.


# Using googleVis with shiny

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is a package by
RStudio, which makes it incredibly easy to build interactive web
applications with R.  

With version 0.4.0 of googleVis support for shiny
apps was added. Joe Cheng contributed the `renderGvis`
function which allows users to use googleVis output in shiny in a
similar way to other plotting functions. 

The following example has been taken from the help file of
`renderGvis`. It displays a scatter chart where the user can
select the data set to be displayed. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# server.R
library(googleVis)

shinyServer(function(input, output) {
  datasetInput <- reactive({
    switch(input$dataset,
           "rock" = rock,
           "pressure" = pressure,
           "cars" = cars)
  })
  
  output$view <- renderGvis({
    gvisScatterChart(datasetInput())
  })
})

# ui.R
shinyUI(pageWithSidebar(
  headerPanel("googleVis on Shiny"),
  sidebarPanel(
    selectInput("dataset", "Choose a dataset:", 
                choices = c("rock", "pressure", "cars"))
  ),
  mainPanel(
    htmlOutput("view")

``` 

You can run the example locally with the following statement.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
runApp(system.file("shiny/", package="googleVis"))
``` 


# Setting default behaviour of `print.gvis` and `plot.gvis` 

In googleVis version 0.3.2 the function `plot.gvis` gained the
same argument as `print.gvis`: `tag`. By default the
`tag` argument is set to `NULL` in `plot.gvis`
and the plot function will display its output in a browser
window. However, if `tag` is not `NULL` the function
`plot.gvis` will behave exactly like `print.gvis`.

The default `tag` can be set for both functions globally via
the `options()` function. On package load googleVis sets
`options(gvis.print.tag='html')` and
`options(gvis.plot.tag=NULL)`. 

Suppose you would set `options(gvis.plot.tag='chart')` then all
following plot statements would print the chart part of the
gvis-object only, without opening a browser window. This might
seem a bit odd at first, yet it becomes helpful when you write R
Markdown files for `knitr` or files for other packages such as
`R.rsp`. 

While you draft your file you may want to see the output of googleVis
in an interactive way, so you set `options(gvis.plot.tag=NULL)`
at the top of the file and you change the setting to `'chart'`
before you parse the file, say with `knitr`. This will
ensure that all plot statements return the HTML code of the chart,
rather than opening browser windows. 


# Using googleVis with knitr

Using googleVis with [knitr](https://yihui.org/knitr/) [@knitr] is a
convenient way of creating interactive reproducible reports. The
approach taken by knitr is similar to Sweave, you can combine R
code with text and formatting tags. However, knitr can also export to
HTML, which is required to  embed googleVis charts.

To include googleVis output into a knitr document you have to set 
the `self_contained` option to `false` in the YAML header:

```
---
title: "My document"
output:
  html_document:
    self_contained: false
---
```

Furthermore, the chunk option `results` should be set to `'asis'`, 
so that the html output is written into the markdown file.

You can either use the `print` statement:

```{r echo=FALSE, class.output="r", comment=""}
cat(paste(sep = "\n",
   "```{r results='asis'}",
   "gchart <- gvisColumnChart(CityPopularity, 'City', 'Popularity',",
   "                        options=list(width=550, height=450,",
   "                                     legend='none'))",
   "print(gchart, 'chart')",
   "```"
))
```

or alternative change the behaviour of the `plot` function via setting
`options(gvis.plot.tag = 'chart')`. With this setting `plot(x)` will no longer open a browser window, but produce the same output as 
`print(x, tag='chart')`, if `x` is a gvis-object. 

Hence, setting the option `gvis.plot.tag` in a knitr markdown
Rmd-file to `'chart'` will automatically turn all following
plot statements into html output. 

Note that you can use the `options()` command in your knitr
file to switch between an interactive mode, where you are likely to
experiment, via copying and pasting R code into the console and
running `knit` on the whole file.

A more comprehensive example is given in the help file to `?plot.gvis`.

# Using googleVis in presentations

The Google Chart Tools are designed for web pages, so it should
be no surprise that it can be difficult or impossible to embed googleVis 
output in traditional presentation software like MS PowerPoint, Google Docs,
OpenOffice Impress or Apple Keynote. 

The easiest way is to include screen shots into the slide with links to
the live web pages. But this approach requires the presenter to switch
between applications during her talk. This can be fun, but quite often
it is not. 

An alternative would be to build the presentation as a web page itself.  

A popular approach here is the `slidify` package by Ramnath Vaidyanathan, 
[@slidify] that builds on the knitr Markdown approach of the previous 
section. An example of a `slidify` presentation is the [googleVis 
tutorial](https://decastillo.github.io/googleVis_Tutorial/) given at the useR! conference in 2013, @googleVisTutorial.


# Using Trendlines with googleVis

A trendline is a line superimposed on a chart revealing the overall 
direction of the data. Google Charts can automatically generate 
trendlines for Scatter Charts, Bar Charts, Column Charts and Line Charts.

For more details visit: 
https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/trendlines

```{r readTrendLines, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
read_demo('Trendlines', 'googleVis')
```

## Linear trend line
```{r LinearTrend, results='asis', tidy=FALSE}
```

## Exponential trend line with equation shown in legend
```{r ExponentialTrend, results='asis', tidy=FALSE}
```

## Add trend line to column chart
```{r ColumnChartWithTrendline, results='asis', tidy=FALSE}
```

## Changing labels in legend
```{r DifferentLabels, results='asis', tidy=FALSE}
```


# Using Roles via googleVis

Roles add the ability to pass columns for further processing downstream. 
Role columns must follow column they pertain to. Proper naming
conventions must be observed. For example, roles fulfilling tooltip
roles and must be called "foo.blah.tooltip". For more details see the [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/roles).

The following examples should help to illustrate the concept. 

```{r readRoles, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
read_demo('Roles', 'googleVis')
```
The first example uses a data set that has the additional column
`pop.html.tooltip` with the first 11 letters of the Latin alphabet.
This column is mapped automatically as a tooltip when the user hovers 
over the chart point.
```{r Tooltip, results='asis', tidy=FALSE}
```
HTML code can be embedded into the tooltip as well, if the option 
`isHtml` is set to true.

Often it is helpful to highlight certain parts of the data. The Google API
distinguishes between certainty and emphasis.
In a similar way to above additional columns with boolean values
have to be added to the data.
```{r CertaintyScopeEmphasis, results='asis', tidy=FALSE}
```

Using roles with column or bar charts has some specifics.
Instead of 'emphasize' use 'style' to change the colours.
```{r ColumnChart, results='asis', tidy=FALSE}
```


```{r TwoLines, results='asis', tidy=FALSE}
```

Setting the annotations style to 'line' allows adding little reference lines
to the plot.
```{r VerticalReferenceLine, results='asis', tidy=FALSE}
```

Intervals help to add error bars, confidence levels, etc.
Note that the options are set either via `interval` or `intervals`, 
if set to all intervals. The examples below give an indication of what 
can be achieved with intervals. 
For more details visit the Google [documentation](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/intervals).

```{r Interval, results='asis', tidy=FALSE}
```

The tool tips in geo charts need a little work around, a `Tooltip.header` 
variable has to be set to an empty string:

```{r GeoChartTooltip, results='asis', tidy=FALSE}
```


# Beyond R

In this section we present ideas which go beyond the usual coding in
R and are somewhat experimental.

## Registering to catch events

Google visualisations can fire and receive
[events](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/events).
It exposes the following two JavaScript methods: 

 - `google.visualization.events.trigger()` fires an event,
 - `google.visualization.events.addListener()` listens for events.

Here is an example of registering to receive the selection event from
the Google documentation:

```
var table = new google.visualization.Table(document.getElementById('table_div'));
table.draw(data, options);
google.visualization.events.addListener(table, 'select', selectHandler);

function selectHandler() {
  alert('A table row was selected');
}
```

We will only deal with this special case of a 'select' event of the
'addListner' method. This event is available for most visualisations
and acts on user interactions, e.g. user selection clicks.

The 'addListener' method expects JavaScript code, which can be embedded
into a gvis-object via `options` as (undocumented) parameter
`gvis.listener.jscode`. 

Here are some examples:

Look up the selected item in Wikipedia:

```{r listener, results="asis"}
jscode <- "window.open('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/' 
                  + data.getValue(chart.getSelection()[0].row,0)); "

J1 <- gvisGeoChart(Exports, locationvar='Country', sizevar = 'Profit',
                 options=list(dataMode="regions", 
                              gvis.listener.jscode=jscode))
plot(J1)
``` 

In the same way we can use the code in other charts, e.g. org- or line charts:

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot(gvisOrgChart(Regions,  options=list(gvis.listener.jscode=jscode)))
plot(gvisLineChart(Regions[,c(1,3)], options=list(gvis.listener.jscode=jscode)))
```

In the following more advanced example the selected value of a table is
displayed in a message box:

```{r message, results="asis"}
jscode <- "
       var sel = chart.getSelection();
       var row = sel[0].row;
       var text = data.getValue(row,1);
       alert(text);
"
J2 <- gvisTable(Population[1:5,], 
                options=list(gvis.listener.jscode=jscode))
plot(J2)
```

# Frequent ask questions -- FAQ

## Is there an alternative for the Flash based motion chart

Other R packages provide alternatives to the Flash based
Google motion chart, such as [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/animations/#mulitple-trace-animations), 
[gganimate](https://gganimate.com)


## Can I use googleVis output in PDF files?

No, not directly. The Google Charts API is designed for dynamic web
output on your screen and not on paper.

For further details see Google's online documentation on
[printing PNG charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/printing).

## Can I change the colour of the bubbles in motion charts?

No, unfortunately not. The colours are set by the Google Charts API and
cannot be changed by the user.

## Why can't I see motion charts when I open them from a local directory?

Note that Flash charts may not work when loaded as a local file due to
security settings, and therefore require to be displayed via a web
server. However, you can overcome this issue by changing your Flash
security settings. Tony Breyal posted the following solution on
stackoverflow.com:

 1. Go to https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager04.html
 2. Click on the dropbox which says ’Edit location’ and choose ’add location’
 3. Click ’browse for folder’
 4. Choose the folder in which you saved your HTML file
 5. Click OK

## Why can't I see motion charts on my iPad/iPhone?

Motion charts (also geo maps and annotated time lines) are rendered in
your browser using Flash, unlike most other charts which use
HTML5. Unfortunately, Flash is not directly supported on iOS devices
such as iPads and iPhones. 

## How can I set axes limits with googleVis?

Unfortunately, there are no arguments such as `ylim` and `xlim`. 
Instead, the Google Charts axes options are set via `hAxes` and
`vAxes`, with 'h' and 'v' indicating the horizontal and vertical axis. 
More precisely, we have to set `viewWindowMode:'explicit'` and set the `viewWindow` to the desired `min` and `max` values. Additionally, we 
have to wrap all of this in `[{}]` brackets as those settings are sub 
options of `h/vAxes`. There are also options `minValue` and 
`maxValue`, but they only allow you to extend the axes ranges.

Here is a minimal example, setting the y-axis limits from 0 to 10:

```{r setlimit, results="asis"}
dat <- data.frame(x=LETTERS[1:10], 
                  y=c(0, 4, -2, 2, 4, 3, 8, 15, 10, 4))
area1 <- gvisAreaChart(xvar="x", yvar="y", data=dat,
    	options=list(vAxes="[{viewWindowMode:'explicit',
			viewWindow:{min:0, max:10}}]",
                        width=500, height=400, 
                        title="y-limits set from 0 to 10"),
			chartid="area1ylim")
plot(area1)
```



## How do I deal with apostrophes in column names?

The googleVis package converts data frames into JSON objects.
The column names of the resulting JSON tables are encapsulated with
single speech marks. 

Hence apostrophes in column names of your input data frame have
to be encapsulated by a double backslash.

Here is a little example:

```{r columnchart, results='asis'}
df <- data.frame("Year"=c('2009', '2010'), 
                 "Alice\\'s salary"=c(86.1, 93.3), 
                 "Bob\\'s salary"=c(95.3, 100.5),
                 check.names=FALSE) 
gchart <- gvisColumnChart(df, options=list(vAxis='{baseline:0}', 
                            title="Salary",
                            legend="{position:'bottom'}"))
plot(gchart)
```


## How can I change the look and feel of the charts?

The charts have a lot of options which allow you to change the look
and feel of the output, see the help files for more details. However,
googleVis provides only an interface to the Google Charts API. If
you have specific questions to the charts then please ask the [Google
Visualisation API newsgroup](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/google-visualization-api).

For frequent ask questions regarding the API check: 
https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/faq.

## Is it possible to use googleVis in corporate work?

Review the [Google Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms/) 
and get in touch with your colleagues in IT / Legal. If in doubt contact Google
directly.
