Description: R interface to Google's chart tools, allowing users
    to create interactive charts based on data frames. Charts
    are displayed locally via the R HTTP help server. A modern
    browser with an Internet connection is required and for some
    charts a Flash player. The data remains local and is not
    uploaded to Google.
