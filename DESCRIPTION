Description: The googleVis package provides an interface between R and the
    Google Charts API. It allows users to create web pages with
    interactive charts based on R data frames, using the Google Charts API and
    to display them either via the local R HTTP help server or within their own
    sites, without uploading the data to Google. A modern browser with Internet
    connection is required and for some charts Flash.
