Description: The googleVis package provides an interface between R and
	     the Google Chart Tools. It allows users to easily create
	     web pages with interactive charts, using the Google Chart
	     Tools, based on R data frames and display them either via
	     the local R HTTP help server or within their own sites,
	     without uploading the data to Google. A modern browser
	     with Internet connection is required and for some charts
	     Flash. Please visit the project web site for more
	     information and examples.
