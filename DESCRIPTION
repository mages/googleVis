Version: 0.2.4
Date: 2011-01-17
Author: Markus Gesmann, Diego de Castillo
Maintainer: Markus Gesmann <markus.gesmann@gmail.com>
Description: googleVis provides an interface between R and the Google
             Visualisation API. 
	     The functions of the package allow the user to visualise
	     data stored in R data frames with the Google
	     Visualisation API without uploading their data to Google. 	     	     
	     The output of a googleVis function is html code that contains the
	     data and references to JavaScript functions hosted by Google. To view the output
	     a browser with Flash and Internet connection is required, the actual
	     chart is rendered in the browser. 
	     Please visit the project web site for more information and examples.
