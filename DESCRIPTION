Description: The googleVis package provides an interface between R and the
    Google Chart Tools API. It allows users to create web pages with
    interactive charts based on R data frames, using the Google Chart Tools and
    to display them either via the local R HTTP help server or within their own
    sites, without uploading the data to Google. A modern browser with Internet
    connection is required and for some charts Flash. Please visit the project
    web site for more information and examples.
