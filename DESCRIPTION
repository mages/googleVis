Description: 
   The googleVis package provides an interface between R and the
   Google Chart Tools, formerly know as Google Visualisation API. It
   allows users to create web pages with interactive charts based on R
   data frames, using the Google Chart Tools and to display them
   either via the local R HTTP help server or within their own sites,
   without uploading the data to Google. A modern browser with
   Internet connection is required and for some charts Flash. Please
   visit the project web site for more information and examples.
