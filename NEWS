Version 0.2.9 [2011-09-01]
==========================

Changes

   o The documentation of googleVis has been update to reflect a new
     version of the Google Visualisation API which was published on 
     13 July, see
     http://code.google.com/apis/chart/interactive/docs/release_notes.html#72011. 
     Here are some of the most interesting features:   
     - Support for dual Y axes
     - Ability to crop and zoom chart area to specific ranges
     - Ability to set different properties for each series
     - Ability to enable or disable chart interactivity
     - Performance improvements in GeoChart

   o Updated vignette with new sections on
     - Setting options
     - How to use the on-page chart editor
     - Using googleVis with other Google products such as
       Blogger and Google Sites 

   o Updated warning section for gvisTreeMap

NEW FEATURES
 
    o New gvis.editor argument in options, which adds an edit
      button to the page, allowing the user to edit, change and
      customise the chart on the fly.


Version 0.2.8 [2011-07-31]
==========================

Changes

   o Updated package welcome message. The message asks the user to read Google's
     Visualisation and Maps API Terms of Use before she uses the functions of the
     googleVis package. 
	
   o The caption gvis-plots contain an additional link to Google's data policy.

   o New example for gvisBarChart using the XML package to chart online data from Wikipedia


Version 0.2.7 [2011-07-10]
==========================

Changes

   o The vignette includes new sections describing:
     - how output of the googleVis package can be included into
       WordPress pages,  
     - how JavaScript event handlers can be added to charts. 

   o Clarified documentation for Flash based charts in help files of 
     motion chart, geo map, annotated time line. 

NEW FEATURES
 
    o New demo 'EventListener' showcasing how a 'Listener' event can be
      added to charts  

BUG FIXES

    o gvisGeoMap documentation stated that the default dataMode is
      'regions', but the function actually used 'markers'. The default
      for dataMode is now 'regions' and therefore in line with the
      help file.   

Version 0.2.6 [2011-06-12]
==========================

Changes

   o Updated demos

NEW FEATURES

   o New interfaces to three more interactive Google charts:

     - gvisCandlestickChart

   o New function 'gvisMerge' to align two charts next to each other


Version 0.2.5 [2011-06-04]
==========================

NEW FEATURES

   o New interfaces to more interactive Google charts:
     - gvisLineChart
     - gvisBarChart
     - gvisColumnChart
     - gvisAreaChart
     - gvisScatterChart
     - gvisPieChart
     - gvisGauge
     - gvisOrgChart
     - gvisIntensityMap 

   o New demo 'AnimatedGeoMap'. The demo shows how a Geo Map can be animated
     with additional JavaScript. 
     Thanks to Manoj Ananthapadmanabhan and Anand Ramalingam, who
     provided the idea and initial code.
     
BUG FIXES

   o The way RJSONIO treats backslashes changed in version 0.7.1 and
     as a result some Google charts were no longer displayed.

Version 0.2.4 [2011-02-07]
==========================

Changes
   
   o plot.gvis no longer writes into the package folder. Instead
     temporary files are created. This overcomes the need to install
     the package into a directory with write access. Many thanks to
     Ben Bolker for this suggestion and code contribution.  
  
   o plot.gvis no longer requires the web server provided by
     the R.rsp package to display the visualisation output. Instead it
     uses the internal R HTTP help server. Many thanks to John Verzani
     for this suggestion and code contribution. 
  
   o R >= 2.11.0 is required to plot googleVis output, as it uses the
     internal R HTTP help server.
  
   o Updated vignette with a section on how to use googleVis with
     RApache and brew

NEW FEATURES

   o The plot function generates a web page which includes a link
     to the HTML code of the chart. Many thanks to Henrik Bengtsson
     for this suggestion.

   o gvis visualisation functions have a new argument 'chart id', to
     set the chart id of the exhibit manually. 	         

   o gvis functions return more details about the visualisation chart
     in a structured way. Suppose x is a 'gvis' object, than
     x$html$chart is a named character vector of the chart's
     JavaScript building blocks and html tags. 

   o print.gvis has a new argument 'tag', which gives the user more
     control over the output

   o Brew example files in: 
     system.file("brew", package = "googleVis")  

BUG FIXES

   o gvisTable did not accept datetime columns.

Version 0.2.3 [2010-12-19]
==========================

Changes
    
NEW FEATURES

BUG FIXES

   o Google date objects expect the months Jan.- Dec. as 0 - 11 and
     not 1 - 12 
   o Fixed typo in the Andrew data set. The Pressure at 1992-08-24
     12:00:00 was 951 and not 51

   o Output is now of class 'gvis' with generic print and plot

     the various parts of the visualisation output, e.g. the chart
     object.
  
NEW FEATURES

   o New functions:
     - gvisMotionChart to generate motion charts
     - gvisGeoMap to generate geographical maps
